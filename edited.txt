I saw an angel

[Chapter 1: Intro]

Amidst the ink-black swamp's embrace,
Each step a whispered invitation,
To meld with earth's gentle grace.

In this sylvan haven I reside,
A silent dweller of shadowed calm,
Where rain's touch claims souls untied.

Within night's tapestry, shades entwine,
In the heart of this obsidian sea,
Emerges a gleam, divine.

A solitary beacon's fleeting spark,
Across the ebony expanse, it dances,
Revealing an angel in the dark.

[Chapter 2: A Smile]

Before her, a smile blooms,
a balm to my very soul,
the finest remedy my existence craves.

Mother's deceit, father's blow,
they pale, insignificant,
beside the radiance she bestows.

Motivation surges, eyes to the sky,
unyielding unity, road uncharted,
we, indomitable and inseparable.

Lost, adrift, in her gaze I find,
worlds untamed, galaxies entwined,
myself, dissolved in her eyes divine.

[Chapter 3: Enraptured Reverie]

Eyes of diamond, light's prism aglow,
Smile that elevates, to heaven we go.
Voice, a melody, in ears it sways,
Lost, entwined, in your captivating maze.

Each glance a dance, emotions take flight,
Your presence a canvas, colors so bright.
In whispered breaths, the universe sighs,
But in your love's gaze, my soul truly flies.

With you, I'm complete, alive in every way.
